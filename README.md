# Image_caption_generator_
Image Captioning with Deep Learning
This project focuses on generating captions for images using a deep learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for generating descriptive captions. The model is trained on a dataset of images with their corresponding descriptions.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning-based image captioning system. This system takes an image as input and generates a corresponding textual description. The architecture consists of two primary parts:

Image Feature Extraction (CNN): A CNN extracts feature vectors from input images.
Caption Generation (LSTM): A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), specifically an LSTM, takes the extracted image features and generates a natural language description of the image.
The model is trained on a dataset where each image is associated with one or more textual descriptions.

Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language used for this project.
Keras: A high-level neural networks API for building and training the model.
TensorFlow: Backend for running the Keras model.
NumPy: Library used for numerical computations.
OpenCV: Used for image processing.
Matplotlib: Used for visualization.
Model Architecture
The image captioning model consists of two main parts:

CNN-based Feature Extractor:

The model takes the raw image as input.
The image is passed through a pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG16) to extract a feature vector (2048-dimensional).
LSTM for Sequence Modeling:

The extracted features are used along with a sequence of words (captions) to train an LSTM model.
The model predicts the next word in the sequence based on the image features and previous words.
The final architecture merges the image features and the word sequence using a fully connected layer and produces a softmax output, representing the probability of each word in the vocabulary.
