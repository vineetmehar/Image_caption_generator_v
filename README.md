# Image Captioning with Deep Learning

This project implements an image captioning model using deep learning. It extracts features from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and generates descriptive captions with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

## Project Overview

This system takes an image as input and generates a descriptive textual caption. The model architecture combines a CNN for feature extraction and an LSTM for sequence generation. The system learns to generate accurate captions from a dataset of images with associated descriptions.

### Architecture:
1. **CNN for Image Feature Extraction**:
   - A CNN, like VGG16, processes the image and extracts a 2048-dimensional feature vector.
   
2. **LSTM for Caption Generation**:
   - The feature vector, along with previous words, is fed into an LSTM network to predict the next word in a sequence.
   - The LSTM is trained with image-caption pairs from a dataset, enabling it to learn language patterns.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for the project.
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API for model building and training.
- **TensorFlow**: Backend for Keras.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations and matrix manipulations.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training progress and results.
